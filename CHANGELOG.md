## [3.4.2] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Replaced synchronous `existsSync` calls in `context-index.ts` with async `stat` checks to avoid blocking the event loop during context index reads and writes.
- Applied atomic writes (`tmp + rename`) to session master index, bucket indexes, and note files so partial writes cannot corrupt runtime context state.

### Changed
- Note filenames now include seconds and milliseconds (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-mmm`) and auto-suffix (`-1`, `-2`, ...) to eliminate collision when multiple context updates happen within the same minute.
- Added bucket name sanitization and duplicate-summary collision tests for context index write path.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/context-index.test.ts tests/unit/context-keeper.test.ts tests/unit/context-autocapture.test.ts` (`46 pass`, `0 fail`)
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Added zero-config workflow skills: `grill-with-docs`, `to-prd`, `to-issues`, `triage`, `prototype`, `write-a-skill`, and `git-guardrails`.
- Added automatic routing for PRDs, GitHub issue slicing, triage, prototypes, skill authoring, git safety, and ADR/context plan reviews.

### Fixed
- Tightened `triage` skill activation so generic `priority` wording no longer triggers issue triage accidentally.
- Ensured fresh installers carry `config/` into CLI staging so local update paths can refresh bundled skills without relying on the GitHub API fallback.
- Added payload verification for `config/AGENTS.md` and all new workflow skill files in PowerShell, Unix, and TypeScript update flows.
- Added a `qs@^6.15.2` override to resolve a moderate transitive audit finding from the MCP SDK Express stack.

### Changed
- Updated skill inventory in `config/AGENTS.md` to list 71 bundled skills and include examples for PRD/issues and ADR/git guardrail workflows.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.4.1`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/config.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-loader.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-sync.test.ts`

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Added native JCE advanced context index under `.opencode-jce/context/` with master index, bucket indexes, and detailed handoff notes.
- Added `context_index_read` and `context_index_update` MCP tools for focused release, agent, config, Android, testing, security, frontend, and general memory buckets.
- Integrated context indexing with `context_read`, `context_autocapture`, and `context_session_summary` so `.opencode-context.md` stays compact while detailed notes remain discoverable.

### Fixed
- Fixed context index note links so bucket entries resolve from `indexes/*.md` to `../notes/*.md` correctly.
- Added `src/lib/context-index.ts` to install, reinstall, and update payload verification so releases cannot omit the new context runtime dependency.
- Created the context index during first `context_read` bootstrap so the template's detailed handoff pointer is valid for new projects.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.4.0`.
- Updated JCE-Worker instructions to use advanced context index when available with safe fallback to existing context tools.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/context-index.test.ts tests/unit/context-keeper.test.ts tests/unit/context-autocapture.test.ts tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test` (`962 pass`, `0 fail`) with `safe.directory` env for this workspace ownership.

---

## [3.3.6] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- Updated Playwright MCP installer/config defaults from pinned `@playwright/mcp@0.0.28` to `@playwright/mcp@latest` so new installs use the current browser automation server.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.6`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/audit-fixes.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun test` (`959 pass`, `0 fail`) with `safe.directory` env for this workspace ownership.
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.5] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Hardened `opencode.json` preservation: install, reinstall, and update now refuse to automatically rebuild a non-empty malformed `opencode.json`, preserving the user's original file unchanged instead of replacing it with defaults.
- Update migrations now fail soft with warnings instead of aborting after a preserved malformed config is detected.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.5`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/opencode-config-merge.test.ts tests/unit/install-merge-config.test.ts tests/unit/update-config-hardening.test.ts tests/unit/audit-fixes.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Added `src/lib/context-template.ts` to install, reinstall, and update payload verification so the plugin-side `.opencode-context.md` bootstrap dependency is explicitly required before CLI source swaps.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.4`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-integration.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Added plugin-side project context bootstrapping so `.opencode-context.md` is created on the first chat message in a new project even when the model skips the `context_read` MCP tool.
- Preserved MCP `context_read` behavior while adding a runtime fallback that writes the standard context template directly into the active project root.
- Configured Fish shell PATH during Unix install so Bun global binaries such as `opencode-jce` are available in Fish sessions.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.3`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/plugin-integration.test.ts tests/unit/context-keeper.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test` (`958 pass`, `0 fail`)

---

## [3.3.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Added a post-compaction no-task guard to prevent greeting-only sessions from entering repeated Build/Compaction cycles when context is full, especially with Sonnet 4.5 via 9router.
- Disabled compaction autocontinue for compacted summaries that only say the assistant is awaiting the user's task/question.
- Prevented greeting/no-op turns from auto-activating orchestration plans.
- Added installer, reinstall, and update payload verification for `src/plugin/lib/compaction-loop-guard.ts` so the fix is not omitted during CLI source swaps.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.2`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/compaction-loop-guard.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-integration.test.ts`
- `bun test tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Hardened install, reinstall, and update payload verification so JCE intelligence commands and Web/API/DevOps/Security flow modules are explicitly required before CLI source swaps.
- Added update-path payload validation in `opencode-jce update`, matching installer safety checks.
- Stopped stale OpenCode/plugin processes after install, reinstall, and update so macOS/Linux sessions do not keep running the old plugin/CLI payload.
- Hardened JCE-Worker stop-early behavior so pending/in-progress TodoWrite items, confirmation prompts, Indonesian stop phrases, review-route completions, and orchestration continuation failures block premature stopping.
- Added installer/update payload checks for JCE-Worker hook files so install, reinstall, and update deliver the stop-early guard implementation.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.1`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts` (`3 pass`, `0 fail`)

---

## [2.0.16] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Registered Token Savings as an OpenCode TUI plugin via `tui.json` so fresh installs load the sidebar widget on OpenCode 1.14.34.
- Split `opencode-jce` server plugin and `opencode-jce-token-savings` TUI plugin exports to match OpenCode plugin loader requirements.

### Changed
- Converted Token Savings sidebar source to `src/plugin/tui.tsx` using OpenTUI Solid JSX.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `2.0.16`.

### Verified
- `bun run typecheck`
