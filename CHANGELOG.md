## [3.7.2] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Single-source install/update payload manifest**: New installs and self-update now verify the same shipped `config/cli-payload.txt` manifest, removing drift between updater, Unix installer, and PowerShell installer payload checks.

### Changed
- **Installer/update payload guarantees**: Runtime-critical JCE-Worker and orchestration files are now audited through one shared manifest reader instead of three separate hardcoded lists.
- Release version synced to `3.7.2` across package metadata, installers, constants, MCP version, README badge, and version tests.

### Difference from previous release
- `3.7.1` improved JCE-Worker explainability, planner visibility, analytics, and safe commit support.
- `3.7.2` is focused patch release to harden install/update delivery guarantees so new users and updating users receive the same verified runtime-critical payload.

### Verified
- `bun test`
- `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- `bun ./src/index.ts validate`
- `bun ./src/index.ts --version`

---

## [3.7.1] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Planner explainability CLI**: Added `jce-worker planner-explain` plus `status/report/trace --json` planner summaries so operator tooling can inspect why JCE-Worker chose fan-out or linear fallback.
- **Safe commit planning support**: `jce-worker commit-check` now supports `--plan` and `--json` to show machine-readable path discipline results and a safe staging summary before release commits.

### Changed
- **Final completion discipline**: JCE-Worker final-text completion claims now escalate to `FINAL REVIEW GATE` during active workflows when verification or workflow evidence is missing.
- **Planner decomposition**: Adaptive planner now fans out explicit independent implementation units into parallel code nodes, records linear fallback reasons when fan-out is skipped, and exposes planner rationale in status/report output.
- **Planner analytics and doctor**: Local analytics and JCE-Worker doctor now summarize planner fan-out vs linear fallback counts, recent planner trend entries, and warn when linear fallback dominates.
- Release version synced to `3.7.1` across package metadata, installers, constants, MCP version, README badge, and version tests.

### Fixed
- Reduced prompt/runtime mismatch by softening absolute parallel-delegation wording and exposing policy-vs-enforcement summaries through `jce-worker doctor --policy`.
- Improved operator auditability by recording planner explainability trace events during auto-plan creation.

### Difference from previous release
- `3.7.0` introduced broader orchestration upgrades, release policy gates, and autonomy/failure-memory improvements.
- `3.7.1` focuses on JCE-Worker explainability, safer release support, and stronger completion/decomposition transparency on top of the `3.7.0` orchestration base.

### Verified
- `bun test`
- `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- `bun ./src/index.ts validate`
- `bun ./src/index.ts --version`

---

## [3.7.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Workflow summary intelligence**: `jce_workflow summary` now reports inferred changed areas and suggested verification checks so the next action is explicit instead of only descriptive.
- **Release delta report**: Added `release_delta` workflow action to summarize changed subsystems, likely user-visible changes, migration notes, and risk notes between previous and target versions.
- **Failure memory foundation**: Runtime state now persists structured `failureMemories` entries, and the operator report surfaces recent failure patterns with root-cause and fix-note context.
- **Autonomy hard guard**: Explicit “continue until done” requests now persist an autonomous execution session and append an `AUTONOMY GUARD` if output tries to stop early while in-scope work remains.

### Changed
- **Release readiness gate** now separates `Hard Blockers` from `Warnings` and scores evidence strength as `weak`, `medium`, or `strong` based on release verification coverage.
- **Skill routing doctor** now flags low-confidence sample prompts and sample prompts that fail to select their expected skill.
- **Routing fallback** now uses a safer low-signal heuristic so ambiguous prompts prefer a minimal safe fallback set instead of over-routing.
- Release version synced to `3.7.0` across package metadata, installers, constants, MCP version, README badge, and version tests.

### Fixed
- **Annotated-tag updater compatibility** remains protected by the v3.6.1 integrity fix while v3.7.0 expands orchestration and runtime safety around release and completion behavior.
- Reduced repeated “continue?” interruptions by tightening JCE-Worker autonomous completion rules after explicit continue-until-done requests.

### Difference from previous release
- `3.6.1` was a focused self-update hotfix for annotated tag integrity mismatches.
- `3.7.0` upgrades JCE-Worker into a more advanced orchestration runtime with smarter workflow summaries, stronger release policy gating, explainable release delta reporting, failure memory, safer routing fallbacks, and autonomous-completion enforcement.

### Verified
- `bun test` — 1042 pass, 0 fail
- `rtk tsc --noEmit`
- `bun ./src/index.ts validate`

---

## [3.6.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Self-update integrity for annotated tags**: `opencode-jce update` now requests peeled tag refs (`refs/tags/<tag>^{}`) and resolves commit SHAs in safe order, preventing false integrity failures when release tags are annotated.

### Changed
- Release version synced to `3.6.1` across package metadata, installers, constants, MCP version, README badge, and version tests.

### Difference from previous release
- `3.6.0` shipped runtime/session-store migration and release flow cleanup.
- `3.6.1` is focused hotfix release for CLI self-update so tagged releases can install without falling back to manual reinstall.

### Verified
- `rtk tsc --noEmit`
- `bun test tests/unit/update-integrity.test.ts`
- `bun test tests/unit/update-process-cleanup.test.ts tests/unit/update-config-hardening.test.ts`

---

## [3.6.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Runtime state layer**: Added `runtime-state.ts` as dedicated home for JCE-Worker runtime persistence and bounded runtime snapshots.
- **Session-store facade**: Added `session-store.ts` to persist runtime state separately from orchestration memory while keeping single-call session load/save behavior.
- **Legacy shadow projection**: Added `legacy-shadow.ts` to project runtime state into legacy-compatible shapes during migration.
- **Legacy runtime bootstrap bridge**: `execution-memory-v2` can now read legacy `jce-worker-execution.json` when seeding orchestration memory v2.

### Changed
- JCE-Worker plugin runtime persistence now uses `session-store` instead of direct `execution-memory` reads/writes.
- Background manager, reports, memory queries, project brain, token savings UI, open-work gate, and CLI helpers now consume `runtime-state` directly.
- Runtime helper/test naming now reflects `runtime state` instead of legacy `execution memory` where safe.
- Release version synced to `3.6.0` across package metadata, installers, constants, MCP version, README badge, and version tests.

### Removed
- Removed legacy runtime shim `src/plugin/lib/execution-memory.ts` after all internal source and tests migrated off it.

### Fixed
- Preserved orchestration memory while clearing or updating runtime-only state paths.
- Kept token savings sidebar reading current runtime state via session facade.
- Preserved workflow runtime fields across load/save and session idle persistence after migration.

### Difference from previous release
- `3.5.5` focused on routing registry, telemetry learning, and skill-health CI.
- `3.6.0` focuses on persistence architecture: splitting runtime state from orchestration memory, removing legacy runtime shim, and making release/runtime paths cleaner for future work.

### Verified
- `rtk tsc --noEmit`
- `bun test` — 1032 pass, 0 fail

---

## [3.5.4] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Automatic human frontend flow**: JCE-Worker now applies human UI design workflow automatically for frontend/UI/design/page/component tasks without requiring users to run a separate command.
- **Frontend design intake**: JCE-Worker asks up to three concise direction questions when target user, visual feel, or must-avoid style is unclear, then proceeds by inference if the user skips answers.
- **Design Taste Gate**: Frontend work now defines visual thesis, density, hierarchy, content model, signature motif, and explicit anti-patterns before implementation.
- **Generic AI Risk Gate**: Frontend handoffs now include a 1-5 generic-AI risk score and require one revision pass when risk is 3 or higher.
- **Anti-AI frontend scanner findings**: Web scanner now flags generic SaaS copy, decorative gradient risk, and oversoft card styling with remediation guidance.

### Changed
- Strengthened `human-ui-design` skill with automatic JCE-Worker mode, max-three-question intake, signature motif guidance, no-placeholder final rule, and Generic AI Risk scoring.
- Updated frontend scanner guidance to prefer automatic intake, taste review, backend state mapping, and visual QA without creating a new user-facing command.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/plugin-agents.test.ts tests/unit/advanced-flow-scanners.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test` — 984 pass, 0 fail
- `bun ./src/index.ts validate`
- `bun audit` — no vulnerabilities found
- `bun ./src/index.ts --version` — 3.5.4
- `bun ./src/index.ts flow frontend --root . --json`
- `install.ps1` PowerShell parser check

---

## [3.5.3] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Human UI design guardrails**: Added `human-ui-design` skill to keep generated frontend work domain-specific, backend-aware, accessible, and visually non-generic.
- **UI pattern catalog**: Added `ui-pattern-library` with product patterns for enterprise SaaS/admin, developer tools, fintech/billing, ecommerce/marketplace, healthcare/wellness, AI products, landing pages, data dashboards, forms/onboarding, and settings/preferences.
- **Visual QA rubric**: Added `visual-qa-rubric` for screenshot/browser review, responsive checks, anti-AI-smell scoring, accessibility review, and visual readiness verdicts.
- **Frontend flow scanner**: Added `opencode-jce flow frontend` alias with pattern recommendations, visual QA evidence requirements, and frontend handoff guidance.
- **JCE-Worker frontend ownership**: Added Frontend Product Design Brain so JCE-Worker is the single front door for frontend/product UI work while keeping the frontend agent as an internal specialist.

### Changed
- Upgraded bundled `frontend` agent with safe public inspiration rules, backend contract mapping, Human UI Review, visual QA output, and screenshot/browser review workflow.
- Extended skill routing so UI, dashboard, landing page, visual QA, screenshot, and product design prompts auto-load advanced frontend skills without requiring manual agent switching.
- Updated web scanner to reduce false positives, ignore test/runtime folders, detect UI patterns from route/form signals, and require browser screenshot evidence for UI completion claims.
- Hardened config/update paths with deeper JSON serialization, safer malformed config backup behavior, unique atomic temp writes, context read error handling, larger command buffers, and safer Android logcat device validation.

### Fixed
- CI validation script handling for GitHub Actions `shell: bash` with implicit `set -eo pipefail`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/plugin-agents.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-loader.test.ts tests/unit/config.test.ts`
- `bun test tests/unit/config.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-loader.test.ts tests/unit/advanced-flow-scanners.test.ts tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-sync.test.ts tests/unit/jce-intelligence-priorities.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun ./src/index.ts validate`

---

## [3.5.2] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Installer version sync**: `install.sh` and `install.ps1` version strings now match the release version.
- **Android logcat input validation**: `packageName` argument is now validated against `[a-zA-Z0-9._]+` before passing to `adb shell pidof`, preventing potential command injection via shell metacharacters.

### Changed
- Bumped all version references to `3.5.2`.

---

## [3.5.1] - 2026-06-03

### Security
- **CLI update integrity**: `opencode-jce update` now verifies cloned commit SHA against `git ls-remote` before applying update, preventing TOCTOU attacks between ref fetch and git clone.
- **MCP env sanitization**: Plugin MCP config now rejects env values containing shell expansion patterns (`${...}`, backticks, `$VAR`) to prevent command injection via malicious plugins.
- **MCP remote URL validation**: Remote MCP URLs now require valid HTTPS hostname (no localhost/loopback, no embedded credentials, must contain a dot), preventing SSRF and injection vectors.
- **Config backup on parse error**: `loadOpenCodeConfig` now backs up corrupted `opencode.json` before auto-creating from template, preventing silent data loss when config has invalid JSON.

### Fixed
- **Update rollback coverage**: `opencode-jce update` now backs up and restores `agents.json`, `mcp.json`, `lsp.json`, `fallback.json` alongside `opencode.json` and `tui.json` on fetch failure.
- **Context update race condition**: `context_update` MCP tool now reads file once and computes hash from that read instead of double-read pattern, reducing window for concurrent write conflicts.
- **Router hardcoded profile IDs**: `routeToProfile` no longer depends on hardcoded profile IDs (`"speed"`, `"budget"`, etc.). Now ranks profiles by `maxTokens` and selects based on complexity tier.
- **listingFailed false positive**: `mergeDirectory` now uses HTTP HEAD check to distinguish genuine empty directories from fetch failures, instead of assuming empty = failure.
- **Log rotation overflow**: Logger now keeps up to 5 rotated backups (`.log.1` through `.log.5`) instead of overwriting `.log.1` on every rotation.

### Changed
- SECURITY.md version table updated from `1.1.x` to `3.5.x` to match actual supported version.

---

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Fixed context index deduplication: was comparing full entry string (including timestamp) so duplicates were never detected. Now compares summary text per bucket.
- Fixed `pruneContextIndexNotes` using `endsWith` instead of `includes` for note filename matching, so pruning actually finds notes.
- Fixed bucket inference scoring: summary matches now get proper weight instead of being treated as weak signals.

### Added
- Notes pruning: `pruneContextIndexNotes(bucket, { maxAge?, maxNotes?, dryRun? })` deletes old notes by age or count, with index entry cleanup.
- MCP tools: `context_index_prune` (prune old notes/entries) and `context_index_stats` (show bucket/note/entry counts).
- Search/filter on `context_index_read`: optional `since`, `agent`, `keyword` params to filter bucket entries.
- In-memory cache for session and index content, invalidated on write. Reduces IO for repeated reads.
- Noise filter: `writeContextIndex` skips writes without meaningful summary (>10 chars) or verification/blockers/nextSteps/android.
- Auto `.gitignore` entry: `ensureContextIndex` adds `.opencode-jce/context/` to `.gitignore` if not present.
- Configurable bucket descriptions via `.opencode-jce/context-config.json`.
- Weighted bucket inference scoring: file-path signals get 3x weight, summary matches get 2x.
- `context_read` response now includes index stats (total notes, total entries).
- Comprehensive test coverage: dedup, pruning, stats, search/filter, noise filter, bucket inference scoring, dryRun.

### Changed
- `readContextIndex` now takes `ContextIndexReadOptions` object instead of plain string for bucket parameter.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.5.0`.

### Verified
- `bun run typecheck` (pass)
- `bun test` (`979 pass`, `0 fail`)

---

## [3.4.2] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Replaced synchronous `existsSync` calls in `context-index.ts` with async `stat` checks to avoid blocking the event loop during context index reads and writes.
- Applied atomic writes (`tmp + rename`) to session master index, bucket indexes, and note files so partial writes cannot corrupt runtime context state.

### Changed
- Note filenames now include seconds and milliseconds (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-mmm`) and auto-suffix (`-1`, `-2`, ...) to eliminate collision when multiple context updates happen within the same minute.
- Added bucket name sanitization and duplicate-summary collision tests for context index write path.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/context-index.test.ts tests/unit/context-keeper.test.ts tests/unit/context-autocapture.test.ts` (`46 pass`, `0 fail`)
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Added zero-config workflow skills: `grill-with-docs`, `to-prd`, `to-issues`, `triage`, `prototype`, `write-a-skill`, and `git-guardrails`.
- Added automatic routing for PRDs, GitHub issue slicing, triage, prototypes, skill authoring, git safety, and ADR/context plan reviews.

### Fixed
- Tightened `triage` skill activation so generic `priority` wording no longer triggers issue triage accidentally.
- Ensured fresh installers carry `config/` into CLI staging so local update paths can refresh bundled skills without relying on the GitHub API fallback.
- Added payload verification for `config/AGENTS.md` and all new workflow skill files in PowerShell, Unix, and TypeScript update flows.
- Added a `qs@^6.15.2` override to resolve a moderate transitive audit finding from the MCP SDK Express stack.

### Changed
- Updated skill inventory in `config/AGENTS.md` to list 71 bundled skills and include examples for PRD/issues and ADR/git guardrail workflows.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.4.1`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/config.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-loader.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-skill-sync.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`

- `bun test` (`965 pass`, `0 fail`)

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Added native JCE advanced context index under `.opencode-jce/context/` with master index, bucket indexes, and detailed handoff notes.
- Added `context_index_read` and `context_index_update` MCP tools for focused release, agent, config, Android, testing, security, frontend, and general memory buckets.
- Integrated context indexing with `context_read`, `context_autocapture`, and `context_session_summary` so `.opencode-context.md` stays compact while detailed notes remain discoverable.

### Fixed
- Fixed context index note links so bucket entries resolve from `indexes/*.md` to `../notes/*.md` correctly.
- Added `src/lib/context-index.ts` to install, reinstall, and update payload verification so releases cannot omit the new context runtime dependency.
- Created the context index during first `context_read` bootstrap so the template's detailed handoff pointer is valid for new projects.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.4.0`.
- Updated JCE-Worker instructions to use advanced context index when available with safe fallback to existing context tools.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/context-index.test.ts tests/unit/context-keeper.test.ts tests/unit/context-autocapture.test.ts tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test` (`962 pass`, `0 fail`) with `safe.directory` env for this workspace ownership.

---

## [3.3.6] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- Updated Playwright MCP installer/config defaults from pinned `@playwright/mcp@0.0.28` to `@playwright/mcp@latest` so new installs use the current browser automation server.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.6`.

- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.5] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Hardened `opencode.json` preservation: install, reinstall, and update now refuse to automatically rebuild a non-empty malformed `opencode.json`, preserving the user's original file unchanged instead of replacing it with defaults.
- Update migrations now fail soft with warnings instead of aborting after a preserved malformed config is detected.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.5`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/opencode-config-merge.test.ts tests/unit/install-merge-config.test.ts tests/unit/update-config-hardening.test.ts tests/unit/audit-fixes.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Added `src/lib/context-template.ts` to install, reinstall, and update payload verification so the plugin-side `.opencode-context.md` bootstrap dependency is explicitly required before CLI source swaps.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.4`.

### Verified
- `bun test tests/unit/install-payload-verification.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-integration.test.ts tests/unit/plugin-workflow-tool.test.ts tests/unit/ui.test.ts`
- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Added plugin-side project context bootstrapping so `.opencode-context.md` is created on the first chat message in a new project even when the model skips the `context_read` MCP tool.
- Preserved MCP `context_read` behavior while adding a runtime fallback that writes the standard context template directly into the active project root.
- Configured Fish shell PATH during Unix install so Bun global binaries such as `opencode-jce` are available in Fish sessions.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.3`.

### Verified

- `bun test` (`958 pass`, `0 fail`)

---

## [3.3.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Added a post-compaction no-task guard to prevent greeting-only sessions from entering repeated Build/Compaction cycles when context is full, especially with Sonnet 4.5 via 9router.
- Disabled compaction autocontinue for compacted summaries that only say the assistant is awaiting the user's task/question.
- Prevented greeting/no-op turns from auto-activating orchestration plans.
- Added installer, reinstall, and update payload verification for `src/plugin/lib/compaction-loop-guard.ts` so the fix is not omitted during CLI source swaps.

### Changed
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `3.3.2`.

- `bun run typecheck`

---

## [3.3.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Hardened install, reinstall, and update payload verification so JCE intelligence commands and Web/API/DevOps/Security flow modules are explicitly required before CLI source swaps.
- Added update-path payload validation in `opencode-jce update`, matching installer safety checks.
- Stopped stale OpenCode/plugin processes after install, reinstall, and update so macOS/Linux sessions do not keep running the old plugin/CLI payload.
- Hardened JCE-Worker stop-early behavior so pending/in-progress TodoWrite items, confirmation prompts, Indonesian stop phrases, review-route completions, and orchestration continuation failures block premature stopping.
- Added installer/update payload checks for JCE-Worker hook files so install, reinstall, and update deliver the stop-early guard implementation.

## [2.0.16] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Registered Token Savings as an OpenCode TUI plugin via `tui.json` so fresh installs load the sidebar widget on OpenCode 1.14.34.
- Split `opencode-jce` server plugin and `opencode-jce-token-savings` TUI plugin exports to match OpenCode plugin loader requirements.

### Changed
- Converted Token Savings sidebar source to `src/plugin/tui.tsx` using OpenTUI Solid JSX.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `2.0.16`.

### Verified

- Linux LSP installer now installs missing prerequisites before installing dependent language servers.
- Added automatic prerequisite setup for Go, Rust/Cargo, RubyGems, .NET SDK, Elixir/Mix, and Coursier.
- Fixed Linux LSP commands for gopls, Solargraph, Taplo, ElixirLS, Metals, and csharp-ls so they no longer fail silently when toolchains are missing.
- Added regression coverage for Linux LSP prerequisite installers and removed stale direct install-command expectations.

### Changed
- Removed generated docs from the repository and kept `docs/` ignored.
- Bumped project, installer, config, MCP, README, and release workflow test versions to `2.0.13`.

### Verified
- `bash -n install.sh`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test` (`688 pass`, `0 fail`)
- `bun ./src/index.ts --version` (`2.0.13`)

## [2.0.12] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Hardened plugin audit follow-ups while leaving the explicitly skipped fallback endpoint issue untouched.
- Protected team profile resolution from path traversal and pinned team config writes to the expected config path.
- Added manifest and MCP validation plus safer registry writes for plugin installation flows.
- Required verification evidence for empty workflow completion paths.
- Expired stale background tasks during status reads and freed concurrency slots.
- Hardened Linux installer tarball fallback by validating extracted repository layout before use.
- Added OpenCode model discovery caching to reduce repeated settings lookups.

### Changed
- Added release context checkpoint for `2.0.12`.
- Preserved Windows installer behavior while Linux installer hardening continued separately in later release work.

### Verified
- `bash -n install.sh`
- PowerShell parser validation for `install.ps1`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test`
- `bun ./src/index.ts --version` (`2.0.12`)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- **35 on-demand skill files** — modular AI instructions loaded based on task context
  - Core: software-engineering, security, architecture, frontend, devops, developer-tooling, ai-optimization, advanced-patterns, sql-database, tailwind
  - Frontend frameworks: React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Angular
  - Backend frameworks: Laravel, Django/FastAPI, Express/NestJS, Spring Boot, Rails
  - Mobile: React Native, Flutter/Dart, Swift/iOS
  - Languages: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, C#, Java/Kotlin, PHP, Ruby, C/C++, Shell/Bash, Elixir, Scala
- **AGENTS.md v3.0** — compact router (97 lines) that auto-loads relevant skills
- **28 LSP servers** — expanded from 10 to 28 (added C#, Bash, YAML, HTML, CSS, Kotlin, Dart, Lua, Svelte, Vue, Terraform, Tailwind, Zig, Markdown, TOML, GraphQL, Elixir, Scala)
- **fallback.schema.json** — schema validation for provider fallback config
- **`src/lib/constants.ts`** — centralized version, GitHub URL, model pricing
- **Shared `formatCost()` helper** in `ui.ts` — removed duplicates from dashboard and tokens
- **CI: `bun test` job** — tests now actually run in CI
- **CI: schema validation** — AJV validates all configs against schemas
- **CI: Bun caching** — faster CI runs with dependency caching
- LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md

### Fixed
- **Security: command injection** in `plugins.ts` — replaced `execSync` with `Bun.spawn` array form
- **Security: path traversal** in `prompts.ts` — validate resolved path stays within prompts directory
- **Security: filesystem MCP root access** — restricted from `/` to `./` (current directory only)
- **CI: `bun.lockb` → `bun.lock`** — cache key referenced wrong lockfile name
- **CI: `--frozen-lockfile` removed** — caused failures due to Bun version mismatch
- **CI: Windows compatibility** — explicit `bun run ./src/index.ts` for cross-platform
- **Windows installer: winget exit code 43** — "already installed" now treated as success
- **Windows installer: gopls build** — stderr progress no longer treated as failure
- **Windows installer: correct winget IDs** — fixed LLVM, Lua, Dart, Terraform, Elixir, Marksman
- **Windows installer: C# LSP** — switched from broken `omnisharp` to `csharp-ls v0.15.0`
- **Windows installer: Java LSP** — downloads Eclipse JDTLS binary instead of non-existent npm package
- **Unguarded `JSON.parse`** — added try/catch in agents, fallback, plugins, schema, merge-config (6 files)
- **Version mismatch** — synchronized `1.1.0` across `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `ui.ts`, `index.ts`
- **`install.sh` summary counts** — corrected from "14 agents/8 profiles" to "30/20"
- **README inaccuracies** — MCP count 6→5, removed Brave Search, fixed provider labels

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md** — rewritten from monolithic 1333-line file to 97-line router + 35 modular skill files
- **Hardcoded values extracted** — version, GitHub URL, model pricing moved to `constants.ts`
- **`Invoke-Expression` replaced** — Windows installer uses safer `cmd /c` for LSP installs
