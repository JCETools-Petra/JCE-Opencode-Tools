## Security Best Practices

When using OpenCode JCE:
- Keep your installation updated (`opencode-jce update`)

- Use environment variables for API keys, not config files
- Review community plugins before installing (`opencode-jce plugin install`)
- Run `opencode-jce doctor` periodically to check your setup
