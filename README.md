## What Is This?

OpenCode JCE is a plugin and installer for OpenCode CLI. It adds a focused set of agent workflows, config helpers, MCP integrations, LSP setup, and maintenance commands so OpenCode works more like a complete coding environment.

It is designed for daily engineering work: building features, fixing bugs, reviewing code, researching libraries, improving UI, and keeping project context across sessions.

## Install

### Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JCETools-Petra/JCE-Opencode-Tools/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JCETools-Petra/JCE-Opencode-Tools/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

After install:

```bash
opencode-jce --version
opencode-jce doctor
```

## What Gets Installed

- JCE OpenCode plugin agents
- 42 AI agent definitions for global routing and task specialization
- 50 skill/workflow files
- 19 model profiles
- 6 MCP tools
- 28 LSP server configs
- Safe config merge and repair helpers
- `opencode-jce` maintenance CLI

Existing OpenCode config is preserved. Missing JCE-managed entries are merged in. Malformed `opencode.json` is backed up before repair.

## Agents

OpenCode JCE does not replace the default OpenCode experience. The built-in `Build` agent can remain your normal starting point. JCE adds specialized agents for tasks that need stronger process, delegation, or domain focus.

| Agent | Purpose | Use When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `Build` | OpenCode's default general coding agent. | You want normal coding flow without JCE orchestration. |
| `jce-worker` | Main JCE orchestration agent. Plans, executes, delegates, reviews, and verifies. | You want end-to-end work handled with stronger discipline and completion checks. |
| `oracle` | Architecture and deep debugging specialist. | You need root-cause analysis, hard trade-offs, or design guidance. |
| `jce-researcher` | Documentation and code research specialist. | You need official docs, library behavior, examples, or repo research. |
| `explorer` | Fast codebase mapping agent. | You need quick file discovery, references, line numbers, and facts. |
| `frontend` | UI/UX implementation specialist. | You work on React, Vue, Svelte, CSS, Tailwind, accessibility, or responsive layout. |

### How They Work Together

`jce-worker` is the coordinator. It can route work to other agents when useful, then checks their output before claiming completion.

Typical flow:

```text
User request -> JCE-Worker -> Explorer / Researcher / Oracle / Frontend -> Review -> Verification -> Final answer
```

This keeps complex work organized without forcing every task into the same mode.

## Core Features

### Safer Updates

`opencode-jce update` updates the local CLI copy, refreshes config files, backs up user files, and avoids overwriting custom config.

```bash
opencode-jce update
```

### Config Hardening

The installer and update command preserve user keys, providers, plugins, MCP entries, LSP entries, and custom OpenCode settings. If `opencode.json` is malformed, it is backed up and rebuilt with safe defaults.

### Context Keeper

The bundled context keeper keeps a small project memory file so long-running work can continue across sessions without losing decisions, stack details, or current status.

### LSP Setup

The installer can configure common language servers for TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Bash, YAML, HTML, CSS, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind, Terraform, GraphQL, and more.

## Commands

```bash
opencode-jce --version
opencode-jce doctor
opencode-jce update
opencode-jce validate
opencode-jce setup
opencode-jce plugin configure
opencode-jce jce-worker status
opencode-jce jce-worker report
opencode-jce jce-worker trace
```

Useful checks:

```bash
which opencode-jce
opencode-jce --version
opencode-jce doctor
```

Expected install path:

```text
Linux/macOS: ~/.bun/bin/opencode-jce
Windows:     %USERPROFILE%\.bun\bin\opencode-jce.cmd
```

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| OS | Linux, macOS, or Windows 10+ |
| Runtime | Bun |
| Terminal | bash, zsh, Git Bash, or PowerShell 5.1+ |
| Internet | Required for install and updates |
| Permissions | sudo/admin only when installing system packages |

## Troubleshooting

If an old global npm shim is used instead of the JCE shim, reinstall or remove stale shims.

Linux/macOS:

```bash
npm_bin="$(npm bin -g 2>/dev/null || true)"
[ -n "$npm_bin" ] && rm -f "$npm_bin/opencode-jce" "$npm_bin/opencode-jce.cmd" "$npm_bin/opencode-jce.exe" "$npm_bin/opencode-jce.bunx"
hash -r
which opencode-jce
opencode-jce --version
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\npm\opencode-jce" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\npm\opencode-jce.cmd" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\npm\opencode-jce.ps1" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
opencode-jce --version
```
